      <br/>
      <h2>Step 1: Find Your Perfect Product</h2>
        <span>- Browse and Read Descriptions:</span>
        <p>Begin by exploring our product catalog. Each listing provides detailed information about the flower’s physical 
        characteristics, including size, color, and the number of stems per case. Additionally, the 
        descriptions highlight the ideal usage themes—whether for <span className={styles.blog_instructions_text}>weddings, birthdays, Valentine’s Day,</span> or other special events.</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Step 2: Choose Your Order Quantity</h2>
        <span>- Select the Number of Cases:</span>
        <p>Decide how many boxes (cases) you need. You can order a minimum of 1 case per product and up to 15 cases. 
          However, please note that each order must include a <span className={styles.blog_instructions_text}>minimum of 2 cases to proceed.</span></p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Step 3: Schedule Your Delivery</h2>
        <span>- Add to Cart and Set Your Shipping Date:</span>
        <p>Once you’ve chosen your product and quantity, head to your shopping cart to select your 
          preferred shipping date.</p>
          <br/>
        <span>- Delivery Schedule:</span>
        <p>Our shipments are exclusively delivered via FedEx from <span className={styles.blog_instructions_text}>Tuesday to Friday</span>. 
          The shipping calendar is available starting <span className={styles.blog_instructions_text}>14 days after your order is placed</span>. 
          This period allows us to source the best harvest, ensuring your flowers travel the <span className={styles.blog_instructions_text}>4-day journey</span>
