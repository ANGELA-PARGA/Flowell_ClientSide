      <h1><span>Handling your product:</span> How to handle dry pack flowers</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>At Flowell, we take pride in exporting the highest quality Colombian flowers to major 
        wholesale buyers across the United States. Our flowers are shipped in their <span>"cut stage" and "dry pack" 
        state</span> —a method designed to protect them during long-distance transport. 
        In this form, the buds resection closed, ensuring that they survive the varying temperatures 
        during truck and air transit, and are ready to bloom upon proper processing. In this post, 
        we outline a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you process your dry pack flowers upon 
        arrival as well as instructions for safely storing them if they are not needed immediately.</p>
      <br />  
      <h2>Processing Your Dry Pack Flowers Upon Arrival</h2>
      <p>Once your shipment arrives, follow these steps to ensure your flowers reach their full potential:</p>
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li><span>1. Inspect and Unpack</span></li>
          <p>Carefully remove the flowers from their packaging. Check for any visible signs of damage to ensure that all products are intact before proceeding.</p>
          <br />
        <li><span>2. Rehydration Setup</span></li>
          <p>As the flowers have been transported in a closed, dry state, the next crucial step is rehydration. Fill a clean container with room-temperature water and add an appropriate floral preservative according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This step is essential for triggering the natural opening of the buds.</p>
          <br />
        <li><span>3. Hydration Process</span></li>
          <p>Submerge the stems in the prepared water. Allow the flowers to absorb water slowly. Depending on the variety, the petals should begin to unfurl within 12 to 24 hours, and be fully open within 24 to 48 hours. For optimal results, keep the container in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight.</p>
          <br />
        <li><span>4. Final Adjustments</span></li>
          <p>After the initial hydration period, inspect the flowers again. If needed, change the water and add fresh preservative to sectiontain a clean, nutrient-rich environment that promotes healthy blooming.</p>
          <br />
      </ol>

      <h2>Storing Your Dry Pack Flowers in a Cooler</h2>
        <p>If your schedule requires you to delay the processing, it’s important to store the flowers correctly to preserve their quality:</p>
        <br />
      <ol>
        <li><span>1. Temperature Control</span></li>
          <p>Keep the flowers in a cooler or refrigerated unit. The ideal storage temperature typically ranges between 34°F and 36°F (1°C to 2°C). This low temperature helps slow down the metabolism of the flowers, preserving their condition until you are ready to process them.</p>
          <br />
        <li><span>2. Humidity and Airflow</span></li>
          <p>Ensure that the cooler sectiontains a moderate humidity level and that the flowers are not crowded. Good airflow is essential to avoid the buildup of condensation and prevent mold or decay.</p>
          <br />
        <li><span>3. Short-Term Storage Guidelines</span></li>
          <p>For best results, limit the storage duration in the cooler to no more than 3 days. If longer storage is necessary, monitor the condition of the flowers frequently and consider a brief rehydration period before final processing.</p>
          <br />
        <li><span>4. Processing After Storage</span></li>
          <p>When you’re ready to use the flowers, remove them from the cooler and allow them to acclimate to room temperature. Follow the rehydration process described above to encourage a full, healthy bloom.</p>
          <br />
      </ol>
